# Cassandra Application-First Design

This repository provides resources for learning and implementing an application-first approach to data modeling with Apache Cassandra. It includes examples of conceptual and logical data modeling, as well as discussions on the key design differences between relational database management systems (RDBMS) and Cassandra.

For detailed documentation and code examples, please refer to the corresponding files within this repository.

Updates will be posted periodically as the project progresses.
