## Objectives

- Understand the fundamental differences between RDBMS and Apache Cassandra.
- Apply the "Query First" design approach to schema design in Cassandra.
- Develop proficiency in Markdown for technical documentation.

## Introduction

In this project we will be taking a live RDBMS and converting to a Query First design approach design in Casandra. The meta data is based on the hospitality industry. Data is collected from multiple centers defined as customers who order In-Store, through the Drive Through, or have it delivered using Delivery method. For our queries, we assume that some of our Cassandra tables will stand alone and not be used to derive other queries/tables. We would like to explore the delivery of the same analysis delivered from a RDBMS and how that could be supported using Casandra as compared to staying with a RDBMS. By understanding the key differences in designs, the tables in Casandra will be designed to meet client needs while maintaining a performant structure that will comply will the level of auditing and data integrity necessary to comply with regulations.  

## Analyze the RDBMS Schema

*The RDBMS ERD Schema is completed.*

## Analysis of RDBMS ERD Schema Design

The provided Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) represents a complex RDBMS schema consisting of several interconnected tables, which we'll examine to guide our NoSQL schema design.

### Key Tables and Their Relationships

- `Items`: Central to inventory management, this table records item details with a unique identifier for each item.
- `Centers`: Represents distribution or sales centers, with attributes detailing each center's operations.
- `DataLoad`: Appears to be a transactional log table capturing sales or transaction data, potentially from POS systems.
- `Meals`: Likely a catalog of meal options, possibly in a restaurant or meal-kit delivery context.
- `Stores`: Details store information, critical for regional sales analysis and supply chain logistics.
- `SUMPI`: An aggregation table summarizing item-based transactions, indicating a need for high-speed reads on item-centric analytics.
- `SUMPS`: Similar to `SUMPI`, but focused on store-based transaction aggregations for regional analysis and reporting.

Each table is equipped with primary keys to ensure data integrity and foreign keys that establish relationships, creating a network of dependencies essential for maintaining relational integrity.

### Challenges in RDBMS Schema

While the ERD is well-structured for transactional integrity and complex queries inherent to RDBMS, it presents challenges:

- **Joins**: Frequent use of joins can hinder performance as the system scales.
- **Normalization**: While reducing data redundancy, normalization can lead to inefficient read operations, especially under heavy load.

### Considerations for Cassandra Design

In translating to Cassandra, the "Query First" approach demands a shift in focus:

- **Denormalization**: Given Cassandra's distributed nature, we prefer denormalized tables optimized for query patterns.
- **Partitioning**: Keys must be chosen to balance the load across nodes and ensure fast data retrieval.
- **Clustering Columns**: To organize data within partitions and provide sorted results without post-query sorting overhead.

### Proposed NoSQL Transformations

- **Consolidated Item Transactions View**: A single Cassandra table can be designed to hold all item transaction data, potentially partitioned by item and clustered by transaction date and center.
- **Store Analytics**: Another table can be focused on store-based analytics, partitioned by store ID with clustering columns that might include date and meal ID for time-series analysis.

By carefully analyzing the ERD, we can identify the core transactional patterns and data relationships. This understanding allows us to architect a Cassandra schema that aligns with the database's strengths, primarily its ability to handle vast amounts of write and read operations distributed across multiple nodes.


## Design Cassandra Schema

## Analysis of Cassandra Schema Design

The provided diagram illustrates a schema designed for Apache Cassandra, showcasing a set of tables optimized for specific queries. Each table, denoted by the "K" for partition key and "C" for clustering column(s), is structured to facilitate fast data retrieval in a NoSQL context.

### Tables and Query Optimization

- `Low-Perform_Item-Cat`:
  - Aimed at identifying underperforming item categories.
  - Partitioned by `Item` and clustered by `Period`, `Center`, and `Category` to efficiently retrieve time-series sales data.
  - Sorts sales in ascending order, allowing quick access to lowest figures.

- `Item_Demand`:
  - Tracks demand per item across different periods and centers.
  - Primary key on `Item` and clustering on `Period` and `Center` to segment data by time and location.
  - `Quantity` field likely used for inventory management and restocking predictions.

- `Total_Sales`:
  - Aggregates sales data across all dimensions.
  - Partition key on `Period` with multiple clustering columns to enable multi-faceted analysis.

- `Store_Sales`:
  - Detailed sales information by store.
  - Partitioned by `Store` for independent analysis of each location.
  - Clustering on `Period`, `Center`, and `Region` provides a temporal and geographical sales breakdown.

- `High-Perform_Item-Cat`:
  - Contrasts the `Low-Perform_Item-Cat` table, focusing on top-performing categories.
  - Similar partitioning and clustering strategy but with sales in descending order for immediate access to top performers.

- `Top_Regions_per_Capita`:
  - Analyzes sales data normalized by regional population metrics.
  - Partition key on `Region` with clustering on `Period` allows for trending sales data over time.

- `Store_Profit_Margins`:
  - Focuses on profitability by store.
  - Partition key on `Store` enables per-store profit analysis.

### Design Considerations

Each table in this schema is purpose-built for specific queries, eliminating the need for secondary indexes or on-the-fly calculations that would slow down read operations. This reflects Cassandra's query-first design philosophy where data duplication is preferred over computational overhead.

### Data Retrieval and Analysis

- **Low and High Performance**: By separating the low and high-performing item categories into distinct tables, the schema ensures that queries related to performance analysis are straightforward and performant.
- **Sales and Profit Tracking**: `Store_Sales` and `Store_Profit_Margins` tables serve distinct but related use cases, indicating a nuanced approach to financial reporting and business intelligence.
- **Regional Insights**: `Top_Regions_per_Capita` table implies an advanced analytics capability, potentially feeding into market segmentation or targeted marketing strategies.

The thoughtful organization of partition and clustering keys across the tables points to an architecture that is ready to handle large-scale data with high availability and fault tolerance, typical of Cassandra deployments.

## Discussion

### Challenges and Trade-offs

A challenge we encountered was restructuring the model of our data to fit Cassandraâ€™s model in comparison to the RDBMS model our data is most suited for. For example, many tables in our database share a relationship with each other and due to Cassandraâ€™s limitations on joining tables together, we had to denormalize some of our tables and create redundancies to fit this model. 

An additional factor our team had to keep in mind when approaching the translation process was understanding the business questions we wanted our queries to answer, which would then determine which tables and fields would need to be migrated over to Cassandra. This approach required careful and intentional consideration about what tables would have to go into our model. That said, the Cassandra architecture would be best suited in scenarios where the analysis that needs to be performed is more direct rather than exploratory. On the other hand, an RDBMS approach would allow for all data to be stored in one place regardless of its current use, thus being able to create more flexible queries as more insights are uncovered. 

## Conclusion

**Learning Outcomes:** To create or migrate a database to Cassandra, one must first understand the questions you are trying to answer via your model prior to building it. The data model then needs to be reconstructed to fit the Cassandra architecture by taking into consideration the queries, which would then determine the schema design. This is different from a relational database whose design is determined by the relationship between the entities.

**Potential Real-world Implications:** Using a Cassandra architecture could come with some drawbacks. For example, any updates that need to be made to the dataset would consume a large number of resources and time that may outweigh the benefits of this design choice, increasing the cost of maintaining this database. Additionally, Cassandra also comes with its limitations on data analysis. The databasesâ€™ query language â€“ CQL â€“ does not easily support features that are critical for many use cases, such as joins and advanced aggregations. If there is a future need for these features, this design choice would add an additional layer of complexity that does not exist within a relational database model.
